  "description": "A simple peer to peer web socket server application.  In order to run the server execute yarn/npm start. Default ports are 8080 and 9090.  If you want to change them just provide new ports as arguments. \"yarn start 2222 3333\". In order to check the WS server you can connect with the simple ws clients. Execute \"yarn/npm client 8080\" in order to connect to the 8080 connection.  This server will just propagate data from one connection to the other and vice versa.",
